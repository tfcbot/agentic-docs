# Tech Strategist

The Tech Strategist agent helps you translate your value proposition into a comprehensive technical architecture and implementation strategy.

## Key Features

- Technical stack recommendations
- Architecture design patterns
- Infrastructure planning
- Scalability considerations
- Security implementation guidelines

## How It Works

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   The agent analyzes:
   - Value proposition requirements
   - Scale and performance needs
   - Security requirements
   - Integration points

2. **Architecture Design**
   The agent generates:
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Component relationships
   - Data flow patterns
   - API specifications

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   The agent provides:
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Development roadmap
   - Resource requirements
   - Risk mitigation strategies

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { agentService } from '@/services/agentService';

// Prepare the technical requirements
const techStrategyInput = {
  deliverableName: "AI Platform Technical Spec",
  valueProposition: "Unified AI agent management platform",
  scaleRequirements: "Support for 1000+ concurrent users",
  securityNeeds: "Enterprise-grade data protection",
  integrationPoints: "OpenAI, AWS, Azure services"
};

// Request technical strategy analysis
const response = await agentService.handleTechStrategyRequest(
  userToken,
  techStrategyInput
);
```

## Output Format

The technical specification includes:

1. **Architecture Overview**
   - System components
   - Integration patterns
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Security architecture

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Frontend framework
   - Backend services
   - Database solutions
   - Infrastructure components

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Development phases
   - Resource allocation
   - Timeline estimates
   - Risk assessment

4. **Technical Guidelines**
   - Coding standards
   - Security practices
   - Performance optimization
   - Monitoring strategy

## Integration Guide

1. Import the Tech Strategist agent:
```typescript
import { techStrategistAgent } from '@/lib/agents';
```

2. Configure the agent with your requirements:
```typescript
const config = {
  ...techStrategistAgent,
  credits: 30,
  available: true
};
```

3. Handle the response in your application:
```typescript
const handleTechStrategy = async (formData) => {
  const result = await config.handler(userToken, {
    payload: { formData }
  });
  // Process the technical specification
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Requirements**
   - Define technical constraints
   - Specify performance targets
   - Identify integration needs
   - Document security requirements

2. **Architecture Review**
   - Validate component relationships
   - Assess scalability approach
   - Review security measures
   - Check integration patterns

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Phase development appropriately
   - Plan for scalability
   - Consider security early
   - Document technical debt
