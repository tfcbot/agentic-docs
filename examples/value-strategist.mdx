# Value Strategist

The Value Strategist agent helps you transform your application idea into a detailed value specification document that clearly articulates your value propositions and target market.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive value proposition analysis
- Target market definition
- Benefit breakdown and prioritization
- Pricing strategy suggestions
- Deliverable in PDF or Markdown format

## How It Works

1. **Input Collection**
   The agent collects key information about your application:
   - Application idea overview
   - Ideal customer profile
   - Core problem being solved
   - Proposed solution approach

2. **Value Analysis**
   The agent analyzes your inputs to generate:
   - Core value proposition statement
   - Profit proposition
   - People proposition
   - Primary benefits and features

3. **Impact Assessment**
   The agent evaluates:
   - First-order consequences (immediate impact)
   - Second-order consequences (long-term impact)
   - Benefit breakdown and prioritization

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { agentService } from '@/services/agentService';

// Prepare the input data
const valueStrategyInput = {
  deliverableName: "SaaS Platform Value Spec",
  applicationIdea: "A platform that helps small businesses manage their AI agents",
  idealCustomer: "Small business owners who want to leverage AI",
  problem: "Managing multiple AI agents is complex and time-consuming",
  solution: "Unified dashboard for AI agent management and monitoring"
};

// Request value strategy analysis
const response = await agentService.handleValueStrategyRequest(
  userToken,
  valueStrategyInput
);
```

## Output Format

The value specification document includes:

1. **Application Overview**
   - Core concept
   - Target market
   - Problem statement

2. **Value Propositions**
   - Primary value statement
   - Profit potential
   - User benefits

3. **Feature Analysis**
   - Core features
   - Benefit mapping
   - Impact assessment

4. **Strategic Recommendations**
   - Implementation priorities
   - Market positioning
   - Pricing strategy

## Integration Guide

1. Import the Value Strategist agent:
```typescript
import { valueStrategistAgent } from '@/lib/agents';
```

2. Configure the agent with your requirements:
```typescript
const config = {
  ...valueStrategistAgent,
  credits: 20,
  available: true
};
```

3. Handle the response in your application:
```typescript
const handleValueStrategy = async (formData) => {
  const result = await config.handler(userToken, {
    payload: { formData }
  });
  // Process the value specification document
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Detailed Input**
   - Be specific about your application idea

   - Articulate the problem and solution concisely

2. **Review and Iterate**
   - Analyze the generated value propositions
   - Refine inputs based on the output
   - Use the document to guide development

3. **Integration Tips**
   - Store value specifications for reference
   - Link specifications to development tasks
   - Update as your product evolves
