Follow these steps to set up your sandbox Agentic Team OS environment. 
Having a sandbox environment is a great way to test out Agentic Team OS without having to worry about breaking things. 
The templates come with example agents. You can use these to test out the system.

## What prerequisites do you need? 

- Code Editor (Cursor AI, Windsurf, VSCode, etc)
- Node.js 20+
- Package Manager (Yarn, NPM, PNPM, etc)
- Dedicated Sandbox AWS Account with AWS SSO

Based on your experience level this process may take you anywhere from  20 mins to a few hours. 

<Note>
  Using Agentic Team OS requires a basic understanding of AWS, SST, Typescript, and Cloud Development.

## How to get started?

## 1. Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my-agentic-project
cd my-agentic-project
```

## 2. Clone the template repositories:
```bash
# Clone Landing Page Template
gh repo clone tfcbot/agentic-landing-page-template
```

```bash
# Clone Dashboard Template
gh repo clone tfcbot/agentic-dashboard-template
```

```bash
# Clone API Template
gh repo clone tfcbot/agentic-api-template
```
Go with cloning over forking because you should be making your own significant changes to these templates. 

Future updates will then not break any custom changes you make.

## 3. Configure Your Templates

Each template requires a set of environment variables that you need to configure. 

For now you just need to set up the dashboard and api to try out the example agents. 

To get your sandbox environment running your will need to set up a `.env.sandbox` file in each template.

You will also need to set up webhooks for Stripe and Clerk to send events to your API.

Lets start with the environment variables. 

### Dashboard
```bash

# sst Secrets
baseDomain=<your-base-domain>
clerkSecretKey=<your-clerk-secret-key>
clerkSignInUrl=/sign-in
clerkSignUpUrl=/sign-up
clerkPublishableKey=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
subscriptionManagementUrl=<your-subscription-management-url>
stripePublishableKey=<your-stripe-publishable-key>

# nextjs variables
NEXT_API_URL=<your-next-api-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_WAITLIST_URL=<your-clerk-waitlist-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=<your-clerk-after-sign-in-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=<your-clerk-after-sign-up-url>
```

### API
```bash
# sst Secrets
StripeSecretKey=<your-stripe-secret-key>
StripeWebhookSecret=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
PriceID=<your-price-id>
ClerkClientPublishableKey=<your-clerk-client-publishable-key>
ClerkClientSecretKey=<your-clerk-client-secret-key>
ClerkWebhookSecret=<your-clerk-webhook-secret>
UnkeyRootKey=<your-unkey-root-key>
UnkeyApiId=<your-unkey-api-id>
OpenAIApiKey=<your-openai-api-key>


## Domain
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<your-cloudflare-api-token>
BASE_DOMAIN=<your-base-domain>
```

Next you will need to load your secrets into AWS into the sandbox stage. For example to load your secrets for the api 

```bash
cd api
sst secrets load .env.sandbox --stage sandbox
```

Next you will need to set up webhooks for [Stripe](/integrations/stripe) and [Clerk](/integrations/clerk) to send events to your API. 

For more step-by-step instructions by template, head over to the [Templates](/templates) page. 

## 4. Load your Secrets into AWS 

Once you have your environment variables configured, you need to load them into AWS. 

SST is used to manage your secrets in AWS. Before deploying into an Envrionment you need to load your secrets via the CMD line. 

This will encrypt your secrets in a S3 bucket and make them available to resources in your stage. 

```bash
sst secrets load .env.sst.sandbox --stage sandbox
```


## 5. Start your sandbox environment

1. Start the API:
```bash
cd api
yarn install
yarn sst dev --stage sandbox
```
This will bring up your API and start listening for events from Stripe and Clerk.

The first time you run this it will take a few minutes to start because it needs to create DNS records. 

2. Start the Dashboard:
```bash
cd dashboard
yarn dev
```
For now you can just run the dashboard locally. It will still be able to talk to your hosted API. 

The URLs will be:
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://sandbox-api.yourdomain.com

Navigate to the dashboard, sign up, and you should be able to see the example agents and use them.
