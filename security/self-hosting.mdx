# Self Hosting

Agentic Team OS is designed to be self-hosted on AWS, giving you complete control over your infrastructure, data, and security posture. Self-hosting is a crucial decision that impacts your organization's security, compliance, and operational capabilities.

## Why Self Host?

Self-hosting your Agentic Team OS deployment provides you with complete control over your security posture. Unlike managed services where security configurations are often predetermined, self-hosting allows you to:

- Implement custom security policies that align with your organization's requirements
- Control where your data resides and how it's protected
- Configure network access and isolation according to your security model
- Maintain compliance with specific industry regulations and standards

## Infrastructure as Code with SST

Agentic Team OS uses SST (Serverless Stack Toolkit) to enable seamless self-hosting on AWS. SST provides several key advantages:

### Infrastructure Definition
SST allows you to define your entire infrastructure as code using TypeScript or JavaScript. This means your infrastructure configuration is:
- Version controlled alongside your application code
- Repeatable across different environments
- Auditable for security compliance
- Testable before deployment

### Security-First Architecture
SST helps implement security best practices by:
- Automatically configuring IAM roles with least-privilege access
- Setting up secure API endpoints with authentication
- Managing secrets and environment variables securely
- Enabling easy configuration of VPC and network isolation

### Environment Management
With SST, you can maintain separate environments (development, staging, production) with:
- Isolated resources and configurations
- Environment-specific security controls
- Independent scaling and monitoring
- Separate access controls for each environment

## AWS Integration

When self-hosting on AWS, you gain access to AWS's comprehensive security features:

### Network Security
Configure your network security with:
- VPC isolation for your resources
- Security groups for fine-grained access control
- Network ACLs for additional network security
- AWS WAF for web application protection

### Identity and Access
Implement robust identity and access management using:
- AWS IAM for resource access control
- AWS Organizations for multi-account security
- AWS SSO for team member access
- Custom authentication flows with Cognito

### Monitoring and Compliance
Maintain security oversight through:
- CloudWatch for security monitoring
- CloudTrail for API activity tracking
- AWS Config for resource compliance
- Security Hub for security posture management

## Best Practices for Secure Self-Hosting

### Multi-Account Strategy
We recommend implementing a multi-account strategy where you separate:
1. Development workloads from production
2. Security monitoring and audit functions
3. Shared services and resources
4. Production customer-facing services

This separation provides strong security boundaries and helps prevent accidental access or changes to production systems.

### Continuous Security
Implement a continuous security approach by:
1. Regularly reviewing and updating security policies
2. Monitoring for security events and anomalies
3. Conducting security assessments and penetration testing
4. Maintaining up-to-date patches and dependencies

### Data Protection
Protect your data through:
1. Encryption at rest using AWS KMS
2. Encryption in transit using TLS
3. Regular backups with secure storage
4. Data access logging and auditing

## Getting Started with Self-Hosting

To begin self-hosting Agentic Team OS:

1. Set up your AWS account structure
2. Configure SST with your security requirements
3. Deploy your initial infrastructure
4. Implement monitoring and alerting
5. Establish operational procedures
