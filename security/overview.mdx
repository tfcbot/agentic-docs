# Security Overview

<Warning>
Agentic Team OS provides a foundation for building secure applications, but does not come pre-configured with enterprise security controls. You are responsible for implementing and maintaining appropriate security measures for your specific use cases.
</Warning>

## Security Model

Agentic Team OS follows a shared responsibility model where security is distributed between:

1. **Your Team**
   - Application security
   - Data security
   - Access controls
   - Compliance requirements

2. **AWS Platform**
   - Infrastructure security
   - Network security
   - Physical security
   - Service availability

3. **Service Providers**
   - Clerk: Authentication
   - Stripe: Payments
   - Unkey: API keys
   - Cloudflare: CDN
