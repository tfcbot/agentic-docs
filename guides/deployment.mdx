This guide covers setting up automated deployments for your Agentic Templates using SST.

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Each developer uses `sst dev` in their own isolated personal stage
   - Changes are tested locally before pushing to a branch

2. **Branch Strategy**:
   ```bash
   main     → Production environment
   develop  → Staging environment
   sandbox  → Testing environment
   ```

3. **Automated Deployments**:
   ```typescript
   // sst.config.ts
   export default $config({
     app(input) {
       return {
         name: "my-agentic-app",
         stage: {
           main: "production",
           develop: "staging",
           sandbox: "sandbox"
         }
       };
     }
   });
   ```

## Environment Configuration

Each stage has its own environment:

```bash
# .env.production (main branch)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# .env.staging (develop branch)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://staging-api.yourdomain.com

# .env.sandbox (sandbox branch)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://sandbox-api.yourdomain.com
```

## Setting Up Autodeploy

SST Console can automatically deploy your app when changes are pushed to your repository:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to SST Console
2. Configure deployment targets for each branch
3. Set up sandbox environment for testing changes

For detailed setup instructions and advanced configurations, refer to:
- [SST Workflow Documentation](https://sst.dev/docs/workflow)
- [SST Autodeploy Guide](https://sst.dev/docs/workflow#autodeploy)
- [SST Console Documentation](https://sst.dev/docs/console)
