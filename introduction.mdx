Welcome to Agentic Team OS, an operating system for building your sales engine with AI Agents. 

## What Problem Does Agentic Team OS Solve?

Setting up a system to sell access to your AI agents in a self-service manner is complex and requires a lot of trial and error. 

While there are alot of code generation tools they mostly handle the frontend. 

Most people get stuck on the backend and the infrastructure. 

If you were starting an online ecommerce business today you would likely use a platform like Shopify, WooCommerce, or BigCommerce. 

These platforms have a no-code interface but are designed where the code is directly exposed to developers and extensible.

Agentic Team OS takes it a step further and provides a complete ADLC (Agentic Development Lifecycle) for turning your AI Agents into a team that can fufill services for your clients and customers

Common issues with existing AI Agent Platforms:
- Black Box No-Code/Low-Code Platform that limits your ability to customize
- Code Generation Tools that fall apart when you need to develop the backend
- You don't control the monetization model for the Agents you develop. You're left with tiny percentage of revenue from the platform.


## How Does Agentic Team OS Solve This?

Agentic Team OS solves this by providing a complete, ADLC (Agentic Development Lifecycle) for building AI-powered applications. 

It is designed to do 90% of the heavy lifting and let you focus on just adding your own custom logic.

Agentic Team OS helps you set up a modular and clean architecture foundation that makes it easy to:
- Add new AI agents in a plug-and-play fashion
- Integrate with essential services (auth, billing, monitoring)

## How Does It Work?

Agentic Team OS is divided into 3 main templates available open source on Github. 

Everything is designed to be self-hosted on AWS and deployed within your own AWS accounts.

Each template is designed to be AI Coding Friendly so you don't need to be a 10X developer to get started.

1. **Landing Page**
   - Your public-facing website to showcase your key benefits
   - Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
   - Hosted on AWS
   - Comes with the standard sections your need to get started ( Hero, Features, Pricing, FAQ, Contact )

2. **Dashboard**
   - Customer portal for managing AI agent usage and settings
   - Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
   - Hosted on AWS 
   - Includes authentication, billing, and usage analytics via Stripe and Clerk

3. **API Service**
   - Backend service to handle AI agent requests
   - Completely serverless and hosted on AWS
   - Includes agent orchestration, rate limiting, and monitoring

<Note>
  Each template is designed to be self-contained and can be deployed independently. 
  This makes AI Coding easier because the context is clear to LLMs and you can make modular changes independently without redeploying your entire application.
  Agentic Team OS is basically a modern take on the Backend for Frontend pattern.
