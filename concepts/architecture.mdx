description: 'Understanding the core architecture of Agentic Templates'
---



Agentic Team OS follows a modular, microservices-inspired architecture where each template is an independent deployment unit. This design enables scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy.

## Core Components

### Orchestrator 
The orchestrator is the central routing component that:
- Handles incoming API requests and WebSocket connections
- Manages authentication and authorization via Clerk
- Routes requests to appropriate services
- Maintains connection state and session management

### Topics 
Topics provide publish/subscribe messaging channels for:
- Distribute messages to queues
- Trigger AI Agents
- Trigger Background Jobs

### Queues
Queues enable reliable asynchronous processing for:
- Background jobs and tasks
- Message buffering and retry logic
- Workload distribution across services

### Control Plane 
The Control Plane manages the system configuration and state:
- User management and permissions
- Service configuration and settings
- System monitoring and metrics
- Infrastructure provisioning via AWS

### Agent Plane 
The Agent Plane handles AI agent execution and orchestration:
- Agent task scheduling and execution
- Model inference and API calls
- Result processing and storage
- Agent state management


## Order Processing

### Request Flow

The request flow diagram shows the core components and their interactions:

 **Request Flow**
   - Requests enter through the orchestrator
   - The orchestrator manages authentication via SaaS Identity
   - Requests are routed to directly to the Control Plane or Agent Plane

###  Event-Driven Architecture

Agentic Team OS uses an event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous operations and ensure reliable message delivery between components.

### Event Flow

The event flow demonstrates how different components interact through events:

**Message Processing Flow**
   - Messages are published to topics by various components
   - Topics route messages to appropriate queues based on message attributes
   - Queue consumers process messages asynchronously
   - The Control Plane and Agent Plane subscribe to relevant queues
   - Messages flow through the system in a decoupled manner
