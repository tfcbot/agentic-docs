description: 'Understanding the core architecture of Agentic Templates'

Agentic Team OS follows a modular, microservices-inspired architecture where each template is an independent deployment unit.

This design enables scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy.

The frontend is mostly static and so the core part of the system is the API. 

The API can be logically deconstructed into the following components:

## Core Components

### Orchestrator 
The orchestrator is the central routing component that:
- Handles incoming API requests
- Routes requests to different parts of the system

### Agents
The Agents are the workers in the system
- Agents are responsible for making API calls and processing results.
- You can control the level of autonomy from simple workflows to fully autonomous agents.
- They do not necessarily have to be AI agents or be fully autonomous.


### Resources 
The Resources are any pooled databases, storage or third party services. 
- Pooled resources are partioned by user attributes using SaaS Identity.
- Resources are accessed by the Agent Plane or Control Plane through repository patterns.


## Order Processing

The Agentic Team OS under the hood is a order processing system. A order is a request incoming to the API. Orders can be processed in two ways:
- Synchronous processing as a Request Flow 
- Asynchronous processing as an Event Flow

### Request Flow

The request flow diagram shows the core components and their interactions:

 **Request Flow**
   - Requests enter through the orchestrator
   - The orchestrator manages authentication via SaaS Identity
   - Requests are routed to directly to the Control Plane or Agent Plane

###  Event-Driven Architecture

Agentic Team OS uses an event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous operations and ensure reliable message delivery between components.

### Event Flow

The event flow demonstrates how different components interact through events:

**Message Processing Flow**
   - Messages are published to topics by various components
   - Topics route messages to appropriate queues based on message attributes
   - Queue consumers process messages asynchronously
   - The Control Plane and Agent Plane subscribe to relevant queues
   - Messages flow through the system in a decoupled manner

## Resillancy

While Agentic Team OS is designed to to help you set up these communication flows, you are responsible for improving the resillancy of the system. 

You will need to implement measures to handle desired SLAs, SLOs, uptime requirements and diasater recovery.  

With that said, since Agentic Team OS is built on top of AWS services, you can leverage the high availability and resillancy of AWS to help you achieve your goals.
