Agentic Team OS uses a simple environment per branch strategy. 

This is ideal for solo developers or small teams where environments will be long lived. 

If you are a larger team, you may want to consider a more flexibile strategy or advanced tag based strategy. 

Each branch is tied to a seperate AWS account for maximum isolation.

Note with this strategy most of your work will be done in the sandbox environment.

You should avoid doing feature work in staging or production unless critical.

You can continue work there for a while before pulling it up into production on the main branch without impacting end users. 


## Core Branches
### `main`: Production-ready code
- You should always deploy from a pull request from your staging environment. 
- This should be a locked down read only environment with limited access to individuals who need it. 
- Developers can not directly deploy this branch. 
- Protect resources here from being accidentally deleted. 

### `dev`: Integration branch for staging
- This is the branch will deploy a shadow environment of production. 
- Avoid developers directly deploying this branch. 
- Instead, create a pull request from your sandbox environment. 
- You can expose this environment to your team or clients for testing. 
- Protect resources here from being accidentally deleted. 


### `sandbox`: Testing environment for changes
- You can use this branch to experiment with new features or changes. 
- You can deploy directly to this branch or from the commmand line 
- Here resources can be created and deleted as needed. 

### `feature/bugfix`: Feature branches/bugfix branches (optional)
- These branches are used to experiment with new features or bugfixes. 
- You can deploy directly to this branch or from the commmand line 
- These will be short lived and will be merged into the sandbox branch
- Automate the deployment of ephemeral resources here for individual developers.
