Welcome to Agentic Team OS, an operating system for building your sales engine with AI Agents. 

## What Problem Does Agentic Team OS Solve?

Setting up a system to sell access to your AI agents in a self-service manner is complex and requires a lot of trial and error. 

While there are alot of 'AI Code Generation' tools they mostly handle the frontend. 

Once it is time to implement the backend and infrastructure you are on your own. 

If you were starting an online ecommerce business today you would likely use a platform like Shopify, WooCommerce, or BigCommerce. 

These platforms have a no-code interface but are designed where the code is directly exposed to developers and extensible.

This is the gap Agentic Team OS is trying to fill.


## How Does Agentic Team OS Solve This?

The Agentic Team OS provides a set of templates that are designed to be self-hosted on AWS and and AI Coding Friendly. 

These docs can be indexed and used to generate customizations of the operating system. 

After setup you get an out of the box customer experience that allows you to create AI Agents that bascially work for you 24/7.

This is the happy path customer experience: 

1. Customer receives an initial set of credits. 
2. Customer can reedem credits to get deliverables from AI Agents 
3. Customer can view status of their orders
4. Customer can export their deliverables to a markdown file. 

This all occurs self-service and with an intuitive straight forward UI. 

No chatbot necessary where the customer has to be a prompt engineer.

On the developer side, you can customize the checkout process, the billing model, and the customer experience. 

Agentic Team OS helps you set up a modular and clean architecture foundation that makes it easy to:
- Add new AI agents in a plug-and-play fashion
