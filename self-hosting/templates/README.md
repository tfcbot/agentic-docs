# Template

This directory contains documentation for the Agentic Team OS template.

## Full-Stack Template

The Full-Stack (FS) Template provides a comprehensive starting point for building agentic applications with a clean, hexagonal architecture. This template consolidates the previously separate API, Dashboard, and Landing templates into a single, cohesive project structure.

For more information, see [fs-template.mdx](./fs-template.mdx) or visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tfcbot/fs-template).
