- Package Manager (Yarn, NPM, PNPM, etc)
- Dedicated Development AWS Account with AWS SSO

Head over to [account setups](/self-hosting/guides/account-setups) for help with prerequisites.

Time to Complete: 30 mins - 2 hrs

## 1. Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my-agentic-project
cd my-agentic-project
```

## 2. Set up your Repos

Create a new repository from the API Template: [API Template](https://github.com/new?template_name=agentic-api-template&template_owner=tfcbot)

Create a new repository from the Dashboard Template: [Dashboard Template](https://github.com/new?template_name=agentic-dashboard-template&template_owner=tfcbot)

```bash
# Clone Dashboard Template
cd my-agentic-project
gh repo clone <your-dashboard-repo-name>
```

```bash
# Clone API Template
cd my-agentic-project
gh repo clone <your-api-repo-name>
```

Each repo will have a `.env.template` file that you can use to set your environment variables. Change the `.env.template` file to `.env.dev` and update the variables:

Also update the `sst.config.ts` files with the an app name. 

```bash
# sst.config.ts
export default $config({
  app(input) {
    return {
      name: "<YOUR-APP-NAME>",
      removal: input?.stage === "prod" ? "retain" : "remove",
      
      home: "aws",
      providers: { aws: {
        region: "us-east-1",
      }, "aws-native": {
        region: "us-east-1",
      }, 
      cloudflare: {
        version: "5.42.0",
        apiToken: process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN,
      }
    },
    };
  },
  ... rest of the config
});
```

For each repo, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn install sst # Upgrades sst to the latest version
```


## 3. Start your development environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set AWS Profile">
    Export your AWS profile for the account you want to deploy to:
    ```bash
    export AWS_PROFILE=<your-aws-profile>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install API Dependencies">
    Navigate to the API directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd api
    yarn install
    yarn install sst
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load Environment Secrets">
    Load your development environment secrets:
    ```bash
    yarn sst secrets load .env.dev --stage dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Development API">
    Start the API in development mode:
    ```bash
    yarn sst dev --stage dev
    ```
    This will start your API and begin listening for Stripe and Clerk events. The first deployment may take a few minutes as it creates DNS records.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Dashboard">
    In a separate terminal, start the dashboard:
    ```bash
    cd dashboard
    yarn dev
    ```
    The dashboard will run locally but can communicate with your hosted API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Applications">
    Your applications will be available at:
    - Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
    - API: https://dev-api.yourdomain.com

    Sign up through the dashboard to start using the example agents.
  </Step>
