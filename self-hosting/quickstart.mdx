This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment for Agentic Team OS.  

Having a development environment is a great way to test your ideas without having to worry about breaking things. 

The template comes with example agents you can use as a baseline for your own agents.

## What prerequisites do you need? 

- Code Editor (Cursor AI, Windsurf, VSCode, etc)
- MacOS or Linux Based OS
- Node.js 20+
- Package Manager (Bun, Yarn, NPM, PNPM, etc)
- Dedicated Development AWS Account with AWS SSO
- Github Account
- Stripe Account 
- Clerk Account 
- Unkey Account 
- Cloudflare Account

Head over to [account setups](/self-hosting/guides/account-setups) for help with prerequisites.

Time to Complete: 30 mins - 2 hrs


<Note>
  Using Agentic Team OS requires an intermediate level of experience with programming and cloud development.

## 1. Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my-agentic-project
cd my-agentic-project
```

## 2. Set up your Repository

Create a new repository from the Full-Stack Template: [FS Template](https://github.com/new?template_name=fs-template&template_owner=tfcbot)

```bash
# Clone FS Template
cd my-agentic-project
gh repo clone <your-repo-name>
```

The repository will have a `.env.template` file that you can use to set your environment variables. Change the `.env.template` file to `.env.local` and update the variables:

Also update the `sst.config.ts` file with your app name. 

```typescript
// sst.config.ts
export default $config({
  app(input) {
    return {
      name: "<YOUR-APP-NAME>",
      removal: input?.stage === "prod" ? "retain" : "remove",
      
      home: "aws",
      providers: { aws: {
        region: "us-east-1",
      }, "aws-native": {
        region: "us-east-1",
      }, 
      cloudflare: {
        version: "5.42.0",
        apiToken: process.env.CloudflareApiToken,
      }
    },
    };
  },
  ... rest of the config
});
```

### Environment Variables

SST uses SNAKE_CASE for environment variables. For more information, see the [SST Environment Variables documentation](https://sst.dev/docs/environment-variables/#secrets).

```bash
# AWS/SST Configuration
AwsProfile=<your-aws-profile>

# Authentication
ClerkSecretKey=<your-clerk-secret-key>
ClerkPublishableKey=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
ClerkSignInUrl=/sign-in
ClerkSignUpUrl=/sign-up

# AI Services
OpenaiApiKey=<your-openai-api-key>

# Payments
StripeSecretKey=<your-stripe-secret-key>
StripePublishableKey=<your-stripe-publishable-key>
StripeWebhookSecret=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
PriceId=<your-stripe-price-id>

# Domain Configuration
BaseDomain=<your-domain.com>
CloudflareApiToken=<your-cloudflare-api-token>

# API Keys
UnkeyRootKey=<your-unkey-root-key>
UnkeyApiId=<your-unkey-api-id>
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## 3. Start your development environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set AWS Profile">
    Export your AWS profile for the account you want to deploy to:
    ```bash
    export AwsProfile=<your-aws-profile>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load Environment Secrets">
    Load your development environment secrets:
    ```bash
    bun sst secrets load .env.local --stage dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Development Environment">
    Start the development environment:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    This will start both your API and frontend in development mode. The first deployment may take a few minutes as it creates DNS records.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Application">
    Your application will be available at:
    - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
    - API: https://dev-api.yourdomain.com

    Sign up through the frontend to start using the example agents.
  </Step>
