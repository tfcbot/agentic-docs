This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment for Agentic Team OS.  

Having a development environment is a great way to test your ideas without having to worry about breaking things. 

The templates come with example agents you can use as a baseline for your own agents.

If you want to try the hosted version of Agentic Team OS, you can sign up for [ATOS Cloud](https://app.agenticteamos.com/signup).

## What prerequisites do you need? 

- Code Editor (Cursor AI, Windsurf, VSCode, etc)
- Linux/Mac OS/WSL
- Node.js 20+
- Package Manager (Yarn, NPM, PNPM, etc)
- Dedicated Development AWS Account with AWS SSO
- Github Account
- Stripe Account 
- Clerk Account 
- Unkey Account 
- Cloudflare Account


Time to Complete: 30 mins - 2 hrs


<Note>
  Using Agentic Team OS requires an intermediate level of experience with programming and cloud development.

## 1. Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my-agentic-project
cd my-agentic-project
```

## 2. Clone the template repositories:

```bash
# Clone Dashboard Template
gh repo clone tfcbot/agentic-dashboard-template dashboard
```

```bash
# Clone API Template
gh repo clone tfcbot/agentic-api-template api
```
Go with cloning over forking because you should be making your own significant changes to these templates. 

Future updates will then not break any custom changes you make. 

In each repo create a `.env.dev` file and add the following variables:

### Dashboard
```bash
# sst Secrets
baseDomain=<your-base-domain>
clerkSecretKey=<your-clerk-secret-key>
clerkSignInUrl=/sign-in
clerkSignUpUrl=/sign-up
clerkPublishableKey=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
subscriptionManagementUrl=<your-subscription-management-url>
stripePublishableKey=<your-stripe-publishable-key>

# nextjs variables
NEXT_API_URL=<your-next-api-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=<your-clerk-after-sign-in-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=<your-clerk-after-sign-up-url>
```

### API
```bash
# sst Secrets
StripeSecretKey=<your-stripe-secret-key>
StripeWebhookSecret=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
PriceID=<your-price-id>
ClerkClientPublishableKey=<your-clerk-client-publishable-key>
ClerkClientSecretKey=<your-clerk-client-secret-key>
ClerkWebhookSecret=<your-clerk-webhook-secret>
UnkeyRootKey=<your-unkey-root-key>
UnkeyApiId=<your-unkey-api-id>
OpenAIApiKey=<your-openai-api-key>


## Domain
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<your-cloudflare-api-token>
BASE_DOMAIN=<your-base-domain>
```

## 3. Configure Your Webhooks

You will need to set up two webhooks to enable the billing system to work. 

### Stripe

The endpoint is already preconfigured in the API template as `/checkout`. 

Create a webhook for the `checkout-session.completed` event using the url `https://dev-api.yourdomain.com/v1/checkout`. 

Next, update your `.env.dev` file with the correct values for stripe.


### Clerk

In clerk you will need to create a webhook for the `user.created` event. 

The endpoint is already preconfigured in the API template as `/signup-webhook`.

Create a webhook for the `user.created` event using the url `https://dev-api.yourdomain.com/v1/signup-webhook`.

Once complete, you will need to update `.env.dev` with the correct values for clerk and stripe. 

For more step-by-step instructions on setting up your webhooks, head over to the [Setup Webhooks](/self-hosting/guides/setup-webhooks) guide.


## 4. Setup your custom domain

Cloudflare is used to manage your DNS and SSL certificates. It also provides security protections for you web app and API.

To set up your custom domain, head over to the [Cloudflare Guide](/guides/add-custom-domain).

<Note>
  If you don't have a custom domain the template will fail to deploy. 
</Note>

Once you have your custom domain set up, you will need to update the `BASE_DOMAIN` variable in the `.env.dev` file in the API template.


## 5. Start your development environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set AWS Profile">
    Export your AWS profile for the account you want to deploy to:
    ```bash
    export AWS_PROFILE=<your-aws-profile>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install API Dependencies">
    Navigate to the API directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd api
    yarn install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load Environment Secrets">
    Load your development environment secrets:
    ```bash
    yarn sst secrets load .env.dev --stage dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Development API">
    Start the API in development mode:
    ```bash
    yarn sst dev --stage dev
    ```
    This will start your API and begin listening for Stripe and Clerk events. The first deployment may take a few minutes as it creates DNS records.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Dashboard">
    In a separate terminal, start the dashboard:
    ```bash
    cd dashboard
    yarn dev
    ```
    The dashboard will run locally but can communicate with your hosted API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Your Applications">
    Your applications will be available at:
    - Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
    - API: http://dev-api.yourdomain.com

    Sign up through the dashboard to start using the example agents.
  </Step>
</Steps>
