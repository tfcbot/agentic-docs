This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your development environment for Agentic Team OS.  

Having a development environment is a great way to test your ideas without having to worry about breaking things. 

The templates come with example agents you can use as a baseline for your own agents.

If you want to try the hosted version of Agentic Team OS, you can sign up for [ATOS Cloud](https://app.agenticteamos.com/signup).

## What prerequisites do you need? 

- Code Editor (Cursor AI, Windsurf, VSCode, etc)
- Node.js 20+
- Package Manager (Yarn, NPM, PNPM, etc)
- Dedicated Development AWS Account with AWS SSO
- Stripe Account 
- Clerk Account 
- Unkey Account 
- Cloudflare Account


Time to Complete: 30 mins - 2 hrs


<Note>
  Using Agentic Team OS requires an intermediate level of experience with programming and cloud development.

## 1. Create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir my-agentic-project
cd my-agentic-project
```

## 2. Clone the template repositories:

```bash
# Clone Dashboard Template
gh repo clone tfcbot/agentic-dashboard-template dashboard
```

```bash
# Clone API Template
gh repo clone tfcbot/agentic-api-template api
```
Go with cloning over forking because you should be making your own significant changes to these templates. 

Future updates will then not break any custom changes you make. 

In each repo create a `.env.dev` file and add the following variables:

### Dashboard
```bash
# sst Secrets
baseDomain=<your-base-domain>
clerkSecretKey=<your-clerk-secret-key>
clerkSignInUrl=/sign-in
clerkSignUpUrl=/sign-up
clerkPublishableKey=<your-clerk-publishable-key>
subscriptionManagementUrl=<your-subscription-management-url>
stripePublishableKey=<your-stripe-publishable-key>

# nextjs variables
NEXT_API_URL=<your-next-api-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=<your-clerk-after-sign-in-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=<your-clerk-after-sign-up-url>
```

### API
```bash
# sst Secrets
StripeSecretKey=<your-stripe-secret-key>
StripeWebhookSecret=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
PriceID=<your-price-id>
ClerkClientPublishableKey=<your-clerk-client-publishable-key>
ClerkClientSecretKey=<your-clerk-client-secret-key>
ClerkWebhookSecret=<your-clerk-webhook-secret>
UnkeyRootKey=<your-unkey-root-key>
UnkeyApiId=<your-unkey-api-id>
OpenAIApiKey=<your-openai-api-key>


## Domain
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<your-cloudflare-api-token>
BASE_DOMAIN=<your-base-domain>
```

## 2. Configure Your Webhooks

You will need to set up two webhooks to enable the billing system to work. 

### Stripe

The endpoint is already preconfigured in the API template as `/checkout`. 

Create a webhook for the `checkout-session.completed` event using the url `https://dev-api.yourdomain.com/checkout/v1`. 

Next, update your `.env.dev` file with the correct values for stripe.


### Clerk

In clerk you will need to create a webhook for the `user.created` event. 

The endpoint is already preconfigured in the API template as `/signup-webhook`.

Create a webhook for the `user.created` event using the url `https://dev-api.yourdomain.com/signup-webhook`.

Once complete, you will need to update `.env.dev` with the correct values for clerk and stripe. 

For more step-by-step instructions on setting up your webhooks, head over to the [Setup Webhooks](/guides/setup-webhooks) guide.

## 3. Set up API Credits

### Unkey

The billing system also needs Unkey to be set up. 

With Unkey you can dictate the number of credits you want to give to your users after they make a purchase and any other API limits you want to set.

You will need to create a new API with unkey. 

Then update your `.env.dev` file with the root key and api id.

```bash
UnkeyRootKey=<your-unkey-root-key>
UnkeyApiId=<your-unkey-api-id>
```

For more details on how to set up Unkey, head over to the [Unkey Docs](https://www.unkey.com/docs/quickstart/onboarding/onboarding-api).


## 4. Setup your custom domain

Cloudflare is used to manage your DNS and SSL certificates. It also provides security protections for you web app and API.

To set up your custom domain, head over to the [Cloudflare Guide](/guides/add-custom-domain).

<Note>
  If you don't have a custom domain the template will fail to deploy. 
</Note>

Once you have your custom domain set up, you will need to update the `BASE_DOMAIN` variable in the `.env.dev` file in the API template.

## 5. Load Your Secrets

Next you will need to load your secrets into AWS into the dev stage. 

For example to load your secrets for the api: 

```bash
cd api
sst secrets load .env.dev --stage dev
```

Do this for the both the API and Dashboard repositories.

## 5. Start your development environment

1. Start the API:
```bash
cd api
yarn install
yarn sst dev --stage dev
```
This will bring up your API and start listening for events from Stripe and Clerk.

The first time you run this it will take a few minutes to start because it needs to create DNS records. 

2. Start the Dashboard:
```bash
cd dashboard
yarn dev
```
For now you can just run the dashboard locally. It will still be able to talk to your hosted API. 

The URLs will be:
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://dev-api.yourdomain.com

Navigate to the dashboard, sign up, and you should be able to see the example agents and use them.
