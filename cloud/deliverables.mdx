## Credits System

Credits are the currency of Agentic Team OS Cloud, providing a flexible way to access and manage our AI agents. 

Our subscription model provides 300 credits per month at $249 per quarter. Credits reset monthly, giving you a fresh allocation of 300 credits at the start of each month. Any unused credits from the previous month do not carry over.

These credits can be used flexibly across our entire roster of AI agents - allowing you to mix and match different agents based on your needs. Whether you need help with research, writing, analysis or other tasks, your credits work universally with all available agents.

Agent based work will typically cost between 10-50 credits per task depending on the complexity of the task. 

Each Agent displays the credit cost and the specific deliverables you will receive. 

## Deliverables 

Each Agent will deliver a specific set of deliverables, which are tangible assets you can use. These may include:

- Written documents like reports, articles, or analysis
- Video or audio content
- Background system actions and configurations
- Data processing results and visualizations

The exact deliverables are clearly listed on each Agent's profile before you begin working with them.


## Accessing Deliverables

Once an agent completes their work, you can access your deliverables from the Orders page. From there, you can:

- View all completed deliverables in your browser
- Download deliverables in their native formats (PDF, Word, etc.)
- Track the status of in-progress work
- Access historical deliverables from past orders
