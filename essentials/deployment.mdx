# Deployment Strategy

Agentic Templates uses [SST Console](https://console.sst.dev) for deployment management, combined with a stage-based branching strategy where each template is an independent deployment unit.

## Deployment Units

Each template in your workspace is treated as an independent deployment unit:

```bash
agentic-templates/
├── landing/          # Landing page deployment unit
├── dashboard/        # Dashboard deployment unit
├── api/             # API service deployment unit
└── shared/          # Shared code (not deployed independently)
```

This approach provides several benefits:
- Independent scaling and deployment
- Isolated development and testing
- Reduced blast radius for changes
- Team autonomy and ownership

## SST Console Setup

SST Console provides a web-based dashboard to manage your deployments. To get started:

1. Create an account at [console.sst.dev](https://console.sst.dev)
2. Create a workspace for your team
3. Connect your AWS account
4. Invite your team members

For detailed setup instructions, see the [SST Console documentation](https://sst.dev/docs/console).

## Stage Configuration

The `sst.config.ts` file is central to managing your deployment stages. Each stage represents a complete environment:

```typescript
// sst.config.ts
export default $config({
  app(input) {
    return {
      name: "my-agentic-app",
      stage: {
        main: "production",
        staging: "staging",
        dev: "development",
        feature: "${branchName}"
      }
    };
  },
  // Configure auto-deployment behavior
  console: {
    autodeploy: {
      // Customize deployment targets based on git events
      target(event) {
        if (event.type === "branch" && event.branch === "main") {
          return { stage: "production" };
        }
      },
      // Configure build settings
      runner: {
        timeout: "2 hours",
        cache: {
          paths: ["node_modules"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Environment Configuration

Each stage has its own environment configuration:

```bash
# .env.development
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://dev-api.yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL=https://dev-dashboard.yourdomain.com

# .env.staging
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://staging-api.yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL=https://staging-dashboard.yourdomain.com

# .env.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_DASHBOARD_URL=https://dashboard.yourdomain.com
```

## Deployment Flow

1. **Feature Development**:
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/new-agent
   
   # Deploy feature environment
   sst deploy --stage feature-new-agent
   ```

2. **Development Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Merge to dev branch
   git checkout dev
   git merge feature/new-agent
   ```

3. **Staging and Production**:
   - Use SST Console's autodeploy feature
   - Configure branch-to-stage mapping in `sst.config.ts`
   - Monitor deployments in the Console dashboard

For more details on SST Console features and configuration options, refer to the [SST Console documentation](https://sst.dev/docs/console).
