<Warning>
Agentic Team OS provides a foundation for building secure applications, but does not come pre-configured with enterprise security controls. You are responsible for implementing and maintaining appropriate security measures for your specific use cases.
</Warning>

## Self-Hosted Architecture

Agentic Team OS is designed to be self-hosted on your AWS infrastructure, giving you complete control over your security posture. This means:

1. **Data Control**
   - All data remains within your AWS account
   - You control data residency and compliance
   - Full access to AWS security features
   - Custom encryption and key management

2. **Infrastructure Control**
   - Deploy in your own VPC
   - Configure network security
   - Manage access controls
   - Set up monitoring and auditing

3. **Service Integration**
   - Authentication handled by Clerk
   - Payments processed by Stripe
   - API keys managed by Unkey
   - Infrastructure managed by AWS
