# SST Configuration

[SST (Serverless Stack)](https://sst.dev) is used to manage the development environment and deployment of your Agentic Templates to AWS. It provides Infrastructure as Code (IaC) capabilities and a powerful local development experience.

## Setup Steps

1. Install SST CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g sst
```

2. Configure your editor:
   - Ensure TypeScript support is enabled
   - SST will provide type checking and autocompletion for your `sst.config.ts`

3. Set up AWS credentials:
   - Configure your AWS credentials locally
   - SST will use these to deploy resources

## Project Structure

Each template includes an `sst.config.ts` file that defines its infrastructure:

```typescript
// Example sst.config.ts
export default $config({
  app(input) {
    return {
      name: "my-agentic-app",
      providers: {
        aws: { region: "us-west-2" }
      }
    };
  }
});
```

## Development Mode

SST provides a powerful development environment:

```bash
sst dev
```

This command:
- Deploys your app to your personal stage
- Runs functions locally with Live Lambda
- Creates tunnels for VPC resources
- Starts frontend and container services locally

## Deployment Stages

SST supports multiple deployment stages:

1. **Personal Stage** (Default):
   - Used during `sst dev`
   - Isolated environment per developer
   - Named after your local username

2. **Shared Stages**:
```bash
sst deploy --stage dev
sst deploy --stage staging
sst deploy --stage production
```

## Resource Management

SST manages AWS resources through code:

```typescript
// Example of defining AWS resources
const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
const api = new sst.aws.Function("MyAPI", {
  handler: "index.handler",
  link: [bucket]
});
```

### Resource Linking

SST enables resource linking between infrastructure and runtime code:

```typescript
// Runtime code
import { Resource } from "sst";
console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
```

## Best Practices

1. **State Management**:
   - Don't delete SST state buckets
   - Avoid manual changes to SST-managed resources
   - Use `sst refresh` if state gets out of sync

2. **Stage Management**:
   - Use personal stages for development
   - Create separate stages for testing and production
   - Remove unused stages with `sst remove --stage <name>`

3. **Team Workflow**:
   - Each developer uses their personal stage
   - Set up auto-deploy for shared stages
   - Create preview environments for pull requests

## Common Issues

### State Out of Sync
If your local state gets out of sync:
```bash
sst refresh --stage <stage-name>
```

### Resource Removal
To protect production resources:
```typescript
// sst.config.ts
removal: input?.stage === "production" ? "retain" : "remove"
```

### Region Changes
To change regions:
1. Remove resources from old region
2. Update config
3. Deploy to new region
