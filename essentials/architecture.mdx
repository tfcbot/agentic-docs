# Architecture Overview

The Agentic Template is built with a modular, microservices-based architecture that emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. The system is divided into two main components:

## API Template

The API template follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

- **Agent Plane**: Contains all the AI agent implementations and their supporting infrastructure
- **Core Domain**: Houses the business logic and domain models
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external integrations and technical concerns

### Key Components

1. **Order Manager**: Coordinates and tracks agent tasks and deliverables
2. **Agent Services**: Individual specialized agents (Value Strategist, Technical Strategist, Growth Strategist)
3. **Repository Layer**: Handles data persistence and retrieval

## Dashboard Template

The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agents:

- **Agent Interface**: React-based UI for agent interaction
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling for real-time updates
- **API Integration**: Seamless communication with the backend services

### Technology Stack

- Backend: Node.js with TypeScript
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB
- Message Queue: Redis
- Authentication: JWT-based auth system
