This guide walks you through setting up webhooks for various integrations in your Agentic SaaS.

Webhooks are configured in the [API Template](/templates/api-template).
## Overview

Webhooks are essential for handling asynchronous events from:
- Stripe (payments and subscriptions)
- Clerk (user authentication)


The checkout webhook is implemented in the billing module of the control plane using the [AMU Pattern](concepts/amu-pattern.mdx).

This guide covers setting up the webhook not implementing the billing logic. 

By default a completed checkout session will trigger an update to the customers API with a refill to their API key. 

Only the `checkout.session.completed` event is supported. 

You can implment a more custom billing model by modifying the billing module. 


## Configure Your Stripe Webhooks

2. **Configure Stripe Dashboard**
   - Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
   - Add a new webhook endpoint with your API URL: `https://api.${DOMAIN_NAME}/checkout-webhook`
   - Copy the webhook signing secret
   - Add it to your secrets as `StripeSecretKey`

3. **Configure your stripe product**
   - Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)
   - Copy the price ID for your product 
   - Add it to your secrets as `StripePriceId`

3. **Enable Events**
   - Select the events you want to listen for
   - `checkout.session.completed`

4. **Testing Webhooks**
   ```bash
   # Install Stripe CLI
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

   # Forward webhooks locally
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/checkout-webhook

   # Trigger test webhook
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   ```

   # Deploy or start your API
   ```
   cd api 
   npx sst dev --stage dev 
   ```
Once you are satsified with the webhook deploy it to your production environment.

## Clerk Webhooks

Clerk webhooks are also implemented in the control plane. 

Preconfigured for you is a clerk webhook that will trigger when a user signs up. 

This webhook will create a new user in the Database and create a new API key for them with Unkey. 

Clerk webhooks are really extensible and go beyond just a trigger on signup. 

## Configure Your Clerk Webhooks

**Set up webhook endpoint**
1. Go to the Webhooks page in Clerk Dashboard
2. Select "Add Endpoint"
3. Enter your endpoint URL `https://${stage}-api.${DOMAIN_NAME}/signup-webhook`
4. Select the `user.created` event which triggers when a new user registers
5. Create the endpoint

**Add Signing Secret**
1. Copy the Signing Secret from your endpoint's settings page
2. Add it to your `.env.{stage}` file as `ClerkWebhookSecret`

Test the webhook by creating a new user in the Clerk Dashboard. 
1. Create a JWT template in the clerk dashboard 
2. Login with a test user 
3. Generate a JWT token using the template via the console 

```
await window.Clerk.session.getToken({ template: '<YOUR TEMPLATE NAME>' })
```

This will return a JWT token that you can use to test the webhook that you can too `env.test` where needed. 

There are other methods to generate a JWT token for testing, but this is the most straightforward.
