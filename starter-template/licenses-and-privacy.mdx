Agentic SaaS follows the principles of fair-code development and is released under a permissive license that allows both commercial and non-commercial use. Our license ensures transparency and accessibility while supporting sustainable development.

## Permitted Uses

Our license permits both commercial and non-commercial use of Agentic SaaS. You can use, modify, distribute, and create derivative works based on the software for any purpose, including commercial applications.

Examples of permitted uses include:
- Using Agentic SaaS for any business purpose
- Creating and selling services built on top of Agentic SaaS
- Extending and modifying the software for your needs
- Deploying instances for internal or client use

## Prohibited Uses

The following uses are explicitly prohibited:
- Selling Agentic SaaS itself without providing additional value
- Using Agentic SaaS branding, logos, or trademarks without permission
- Removing or altering copyright notices and license information
- Marketing your service as an "official" or "certified" version when it's not

## Examples

### Permitted Example

**Scenario**: Bob's consulting company implements Agentic SaaS for clients, extends its functionality, and hosts customized instances.

**Why it's permitted**: Bob's company is adding value through customization, implementation services, and professional support. They're not just reselling the software itself but providing additional services and features.

### Prohibited Example

**Scenario**: Company X uses Agentic SaaS branding and markets their service as "Official Agentic SaaS Hosting."

**Why it's prohibited**: This misleadingly suggests official endorsement or certification and uses the branding without permission. Company X should make it clear that their offering is a hosting service for Agentic SaaS without implying they are the official provider.
